# Drift Rocket

Disclaimer to anyone looking through the code, this is a casual solo project so it's is neither well commented nor has it been refactored.

# Goal

The goal of this project was to design a game that was fun to control and required minimal input.  The target platform is mobile and web, with a goal on easy and quick to play.

# Project Status

Drift Rocket was mostly made in a 2 week span in 2019 and I've been slowly adding to it since then.

# Missing Assets

Not all the assets are in this repo, but the main portion of the game is.  If you're curious how it works feel free to poke around.
